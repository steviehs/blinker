# blinker
blinker app for cardIO
The idea is to use the [card10](git@github.com:steviehs/blinker.git)
as a test unit to develop a gyro activated blinker app:

if you rais your arm outside on the bicycle, the blinker starts for a
few seconds and then goes off again.

Right now, the status is unclear: after several checks, it seems
that the output of the gyro is not really deterministic.
